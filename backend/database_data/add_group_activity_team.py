Add Group Activity Team Script for Sportify Backend Development

This script adds comprehensive group activity teams to the database with all possible fields populated.
Use this during development to create test teams with realistic data.

USAGE:
    python -m backend.database_data.add_group_activity_team

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
- Creates multiple activity teams with ALL possible fields from the GroupActivityTeam model
- Sets up different activity types and difficulty levels
- Configures team capacity and booking systems
- Sets various pricing models
- Creates teams for different demographics and interests

- category: str - Type of activity (e.g., "Running", "Yoga", "CrossFit")
- location: str - Where the team meets
- date_and_time: datetime - When the team meets (specific datetime)
- age_range: Optional[str] - Age range like "18-25", "Any"

- players_needed: int - Maximum number of participants needed
- current_players_count: int - Current number of enrolled participants (starts at 0)
- players_enrolled: List[str] - List of user IDs who joined (empty initially)

- photo_base64: Optional[str] - Base64 encoded photo data

ACTIVITY TYPES:

PHOTO DATA:
- photo_base64: Base64 encoded image data (PNG, JPEG, etc.)

- Can be None if no photo is provided

DO NOT:
- Use duplicate team names for same activity type
- Set team_id manually (auto-generated)
