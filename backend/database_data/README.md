## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Database Persistence
- All scripts modify the **real database**
- Data persists between runs
- Use with caution in production environments

### Duplicate Prevention
- User emails must be unique
- Gym names should be unique per location
- Team names should be unique per activity type

### Error Handling
- Scripts include comprehensive error handling
- Failed operations are logged with details
- Partial failures don't stop script execution

### Dependencies
- Scripts use existing CRUD operations
- Rely on backend models and schemas
- Require all backend dependencies

## üéØ Development Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**: Run all scripts to create base data
2. **Feature Testing**: Use created entities for specific feature testing
3. **Data Cleanup**: Clear database and re-run scripts as needed
4. **Customization**: Modify scripts for specific testing scenarios

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all backend dependencies are installed
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Ensure proper Python path configuration
4. Review error messages for specific issues

These scripts provide a solid foundation for development and testing of the Sportify backend system!
